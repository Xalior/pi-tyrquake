//
// kernel.h — the Circle kernel that hosts TyrQuake.
//
// Device ownership: this kernel brings up interrupts, the timer, a serial
// console carrying stdio, the SD card (FatFs, holding the game's PAK files
// and its configuration) and the cooperative scheduler. Video, USB input and
// audio belong to circle-libsdl2 and are created inside SDL_Init when the
// game calls it. So do the CPU clock and the case fan, which the shim
// manages for its host; this kernel only says when they come up.
//
// Core roles, and the reason there are three of them:
//
//   core 0   the HARDWARE core. Circle's world lives here — scheduler,
//            interrupts, USB, the SD card, sound — and by construction no
//            other core may touch a device at all. It also runs the shim's
//            servo, which answers the other cores' marshalled calls.
//   core 1   the APPLICATION core. Quake, alone: the game loop and the
//            software renderer, and nothing else. Every platform call it
//            makes is marshalled back to core 0 by the shim.
//   core 2   the elected PRESENTATION core. It consumes the shim's frame
//            mailbox: scale, compose, present. Electing it is this
//            kernel's decision, not the library's — the library never
//            starts a core.
//   core 3   parked.
//
// `rapi-split=0` in cmdline.txt collapses all of this back onto core 0, so
// the split and the single-core path can be measured against each other on
// one binary.
