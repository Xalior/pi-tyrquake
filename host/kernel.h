//
// kernel.h — the Circle kernel that hosts TyrQuake.
//
// Device ownership: this kernel brings up interrupts, the timer, a serial
// console carrying stdio, the SD card (FatFs, holding the game's PAK files
// and its configuration), the USB host controller and the cooperative
// scheduler. Video and audio belong to circle-libsdl2 and are created inside
// SDL_Init when the game calls it. So do the CPU clock and the case fan,
// which the shim manages for its host; this kernel only says when they come
// up.
//
// USB IS THIS KERNEL'S, and it is brought up in Initialize with everything
// else, before the split arms and before the game's first instruction. The
// shim finds the controller and pumps it; it never builds one. It cannot: the
// shim's device work is marshalled to core 0's servo, and the servo is what
// makes core 0 answer anybody, so a bring-up that runs there and takes its
// time stops the machine. Bring-up belongs where it can take as long as it
// likes, and that is here.
//
// Core roles, and the reason there are three of them:
//
//   core 0   the HARDWARE core. Circle's world lives here — scheduler,
//            interrupts, USB, the SD card, sound — and by construction no
//            other core may touch a device at all. It also runs the shim's
//            servo, which answers the other cores' marshalled calls.
//   core 1   the APPLICATION core. Quake, alone: the game loop and the
//            software renderer, and nothing else. Every platform call it
//            makes is marshalled back to core 0 by the shim.
//   core 2   the elected PRESENTATION core. It consumes the shim's frame
//            mailbox: scale, compose, present. Electing it is this
//            kernel's decision, not the library's — the library never
//            starts a core.
//   core 3   parked.
